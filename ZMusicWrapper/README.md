# Managed wrapper for ZMusic
This is a managed wrapper for [ZMusic](https://github.com/ZDoom/ZMusic), as used in [Helion](https://github.com/Helion-Engine/Helion).

To use this wrapper, you will either need to build ZMusic from source and include the native .dll/.so file in your output directory, or use the precompiled versions available in this project's source repository: https://github.com/Helion-Engine/ZMusicWrapper.  Please see the repository for a simple "demo" program which uses this library as a simple music player with streaming OpenAL output.
